# Vending-Machine
This C++ project implements and simulates real vending machine.  
The best and more effetive way to implement it is to use [state pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern).  
## Machine States:
1. No Selection State:  
The initial state that the customer has not selected the item.  
2. Has Selection State:  
The customer has selected the item and is ready to insert some money.  
3. Inserted Money State:  
The customer has inserted the money and is ready to make a transaction.
